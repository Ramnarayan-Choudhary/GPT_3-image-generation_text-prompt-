# GPT_3-image-generation_text-prompt-
In the project_colab file i tried to creat a architecture using CUB_200_2011 data set but i am unable to finish because due to version miss-match and in  my laptop the pytorch version 0.10.... is missing so i am unable to load my model after a multiple try. 
so in secend part i used the pretrained modle of min_dalle and now i generate a little code to develope images on text response 
and dataset are given above
